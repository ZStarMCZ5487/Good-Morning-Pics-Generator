Sleep well and let the stars watch over you.
Wishing you a night full of peace and sweet dreams.
Rest easy, tomorrow’s waiting with new possibilities.
May your dreams be kind and your rest be deep.
As the moon rises, may your thoughts settle like quiet waves.
Let the silence of the night wrap you in calm.
The day bows out—may the night bring you clarity and comfort.
